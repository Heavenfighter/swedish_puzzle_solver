## <a name="limitations"></a>Limitations

Since there are many different types of puzzles, the graphical recognition is not always reliable and needs to be improved.
Also the text recognition with tesseract doesn't work for all clues.

Some limitations are:

- supports only german language 
- no puzzles with cut-outs (advertising block or solution block in the grid), only completely rectangular grids
- weird kind of clue arrows aren't supported, only straight arrows (top and down or in 90Â° angles) 
- minimum resolution of the image 600x600
